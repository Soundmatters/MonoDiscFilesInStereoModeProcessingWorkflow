## Audio Preservation Master File workflow for lateral-cut discs: mono analog disc recordings which have been transferred and reformatted in the “stereo” mode.

Audio Preservation Master files of mono lateral-cut shellac, vinyl and lacquer discs are produced by transfering and capturing the disc's signal in the "stereo" mode.  This approach allows restorers the opportunity to perform specific digital signal processes on the Audio Preservation Master files that would be impossible had the discs been transfered in the "mono" mode; these process include phase correction, groove-wall balance, and the ability to select/eliminate specific groove wall signals should damage occur in one or the other.

The following workflow for processing the Audio Preservation Master file will optimize its lateral signal, eliminate its vertical signal, reduce any phase problems which may have occured in the disc cutting or transfer, and will render a file with a mono soundfield.  


1. Load the Preservation Master file into the DAW.   

1. Run the phase correction process on the Preservation Master file.  

1. Put the new phase-corrected file’s Left channel in the first track of the multi-track DAW; 1) pan the track’s mixer strip in the center position, and 2)
lower its gain to -6db.   

1. Put the phase corrected file’s Right channel in the second track of the multi-track DAW; 1) pan the track’s mixer strip in the center position, and 2)
lower its gain to -6db. 

1. Reverse the phase on the first track’s mixer strip.  

1. Nudge the gain, plus or minus, on the first mixer strip to null the signal [Ideally, this adjustment will completely cancel the lateral component of the signal, leaving only the vertical component –which is mostly rumble, noise, and some clicks and pops].   

1. Return the phase on the first mixer strip to the normal position [Ideally, this new balance between the Left and Right channels will completely cancel the vertical component of the signal, leaving only the lateral component –which is the intended signal].   

1. Render a new mono file from the mix.  

1. Continue with any other restoration signal processes (de-click, etc.) as needed.
